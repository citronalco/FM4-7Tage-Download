# FM4 7-Tage Download
The Austrian radio station FM4 publishes recordings of all of their shows during the last 7 days on its website.

This Python 3 script is a simple command line tool to download all currently available recordings for a specific show as MP3 files.
The show's metadata gets stored in the downloaded files' ID3 tags (see below).

Files aready present are skipped, so it is well suited for cron jobs.

### Requirements
Python 3 with modules "mutagen", "requests" and optionally "pydub".
(On Debian/Ubuntu/Mint: `sudo apt install python3 python3-mutagen python3-requests pydub`)

FM4 splits some shows (e.g. "Morning Show") into multiple files, probably to cut out advertisements.
This script will download all those files and, with installed **"pydub"** Python module, merge them into a single MP3 file.
If "pydub" is not installed the parts are saved as seperate MP3 files and named accordingy (e.g. "FM4 Morning Show 2020-09-03 06_00 **[1_5]**.mp3, FM4 Morning Show 2020-09-03 06_00 **[2_5]**.mp3, ...).

### Usage
```./fm4-7tage-download.py <ShowTitle> <TargetDirectory>```

**Example:**

```./fm4-7tage-download.py "morning show" Downloads/Morning-Show-Recordings```

This would download all available recordings of "Morning Show" and save them with correct ID3 tags in the "Downloads/Morning-Show-Recordings" directory.

Be patient, FM4 throttles downloads.

## ID3 Tags
The metadata provided by FM4 is used **extensively** to set the ID3v2.3 tags for downloaded recordings.

**Example:**

The downloaded file `Downloads/Morning-Show-Recordings/FM4 Morning Show 2020-09-18 06_00.mp3` gets this ID3 tag:
